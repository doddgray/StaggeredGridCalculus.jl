# StaggeredGridCalculus

StaggeredGridCalculus implements various differential and integral operators for vector
fields.  The vector fields are discretized on a staggered finite-difference grid (aka Yee's
grid) for 2nd-order accuracy in derivatives.

StaggeredGridCalculus is still under development, and it is intended to be used as an API
 for developing vector PDE solvers.
